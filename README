unfortunately, no. this is very nsfw for the actual submission. What do I mean
by that? _They_ expect a dumb(er) version with handwritten aim, algorithm, and
result. i'll probably be making a sfw version soon enough. but until then,
let this be a playground for learning latex.

please do **not** pay any attention to this.
